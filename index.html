                <p style="color: white;">
                    Researchers have developed robotic “muscles” that 
                    are 1,000 times stronger than human beings. Scientists
                     at UC Berkeley have produced muscles for robots using
                      a material called vanadium oxide that's more commonly
                     used within cameras, data storage, and missile guidance 
                     systems

                <h3 style="color: yellow;">WHY WE NEED ROBOTS ?</h3>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    Robots save workers from performing dangerous
                 tasks. They can work in hazardous conditions,
                such as poor lighting, toxic chemicals, 
                or tight spaces. They are capable of lifting heavy loads
                 without injury or tiring. Robots increase worker safety by
                  preventing accidents since humans are not performing risky
                   jobs.

                <p style="color: white;">
                    The one word answre is YES. We've been warned for years that artificial
                     intelligence is taking over the world. PwC
                      predicts that by the mid-2030s, up to 30%
                       of jobs could be automated. CBS News reports 
                       machines could replace 40% of the world's workers
                        within 15 to 25 years.

                    Robots make industries, companies,
                     and manufacturers more efficient. By 
                     increasing productivity and decreasing 
                     downtime, robotic automation is an excellent
                      way to improve efficiency and perfomance for any industry

                        <p>We set out to build an Arduino-controlled and stabilized, GPS-enabled first-person-view (FPV) quadcopter drone with return to home, go to coordinate, and GPS hold functions. We naively assumed that combining existing Arduino programs and wiring for a quadcopter without GPS with those of a GPS transmission system would be relatively straightforward and that we could quickly move on to more complex programming tasks.

                            Various feature projects were discussed in the program which included 
                            A brief introduction about various projects were given in the program 
                            which included line following robot, water Management system, and many
